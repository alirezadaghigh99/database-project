# Database Project: Online Food Delivery System
This repository contains codes, diagrams, tables and documentations for an online food delivery system's database and is designed for *CE40384 (Database Design) Course Project* at Sharif University of Technology, Fall 2019. Tables and queries are implemented using **PostgreSQL**. 

## Phases
For doing this big project, project is divided into four phases. Discription of each phase will be provided in next sections.

### Phase 0
In this phase, we researched on different kinds of databases and DBMS to find out best database to satisfy our constraints for this project.

### Phase 1
In this phase we designed **Extended Entity Relationship Model** for our system.

### Phase 2
After we created EER in phase 1, we had to create our models and relations. 
In this phase we constructed our tables in database using postgresql.

### Phase 3
After our tables got implemented, we had to write some triggers for different events that occured in system. for example when a user ordered food, tables had to update themselves. We wrote some triggers to handle these events. Furthermore we added some views to the project.
